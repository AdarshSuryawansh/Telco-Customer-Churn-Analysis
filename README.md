# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

This project analyzes customer churn for a telecom company, aiming to identify factors that influence whether customers are likely to leave the company (churn). By exploring various customer features such as demographics, services subscribed, and charges, the goal is to create insights that can help in retaining customers.

## Project Overview

The dataset used in this project contains various attributes of telecom customers, including:

- **Customer Information**: `customerID`, `gender`, `SeniorCitizen`, `Partner`, `Dependents`
- **Services Used**: `PhoneService`, `MultipleLines`, `InternetService`, `OnlineSecurity`, `TechSupport`, etc.
- **Contract and Billing Information**: `Contract`, `PaperlessBilling`, `PaymentMethod`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`
- **Target Variable**: `Churn` (indicates whether a customer churned or not)

The notebook uses Python libraries such as:
- `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy` for numerical computations
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization

## Key Steps in the Analysis

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and inspected for any missing values or discrepancies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Various visualizations are created to understand the distribution of features and their relationship with the churn variable.
3. **Preprocessing**: Data is cleaned and preprocessed, including handling missing values and converting categorical variables into numerical formats for modeling.
4. **Modeling**: Machine learning models can be implemented to predict customer churn, though specific models may vary based on the notebook's development.

## Conclusion

This project provides a structured approach to understanding the factors that drive customer churn in the telecom sector. It highlights the importance of customer retention strategies based on data-driven insights.
